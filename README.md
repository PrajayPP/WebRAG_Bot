WebRAG Bot: Chat with Websites
WebRAG Bot is an interactive Streamlit application that leverages the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable conversational queries on any website's content. By simply providing a URL, users can chat with the website, asking questions and receiving context-aware answers.

The application dynamically ingests website content, splits it into chunks, and creates a vector store for efficient semantic search. It uses LangChain's history-aware retrieval and conversational chains to maintain context throughout the dialogue, providing a seamless and intelligent chat experience.
